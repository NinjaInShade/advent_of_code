- . = open space, # = tree
- Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of right 3 and down 1, return how many trees would you encounter.

## Part 2

- Determine the number of trees you would encounter if, for each of the following slopes, you start at the top-left corner and traverse the map all the way to the bottom:

- Right 1, down 1.
- Right 3, down 1. (This is the slope you already checked.)
- Right 5, down 1.
- Right 7, down 1.
- Right 1, down 2.
- In the above example, these slopes would find 2, 7, 3, 4, and 2 tree(s) respectively; multiplied together, these produce the answer 336.

Return what you get if you multiply together the number of trees encountered on each of the listed slopes.
