- This list represents answers from five groups:

- The first group contains one person who answered "yes" to 3 questions: a, b, and c.
- The second group contains three people; combined, they answered "yes" to 3 questions: a, b, and c.
- The third group contains two people; combined, they answered "yes" to 3 questions: a, b, and c.
- The fourth group contains four people; combined, they answered "yes" to only 1 question, a.
- The last group contains one person who answered "yes" to only 1 question, b.
- In this example, the sum of these counts is 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 11.

- For each group, count the number of questions to which anyone answered "yes". Return the sum of these counts.

## Part 2

- You don't need to identify the questions to which anyone answered "yes"; you need to identify the questions to which everyone answered "yes"!
