# Welcome

## These are my submissions for the 2020 advent of code challenge. I have tested each submission to make sure it works.

## I used javascript for this with node js so i don't need the browser. To test my output run node on the file. Each of my submissions per day is a function which i console.log the output of at the end.

### Each day is it's own folder so you can check the code out easily. Inside the folder is the input_file, a readme with context and the code file. For all challenges, i've tried to use relevant code architectures to make my code easy to read and re-usable.
