# Welcome

## These are my submissions for the 2020 advent of code challenge. I have tested each submission to make sure it works.

## I used javascript for this with node js so i don't need the browser. To test my output run node on the file. Every day's submission are 2 functions for each part of the challenge and i output results to both functions.

### Each day is it's own folder so you can check the code out easily. Inside the folder is the input_file, a readme with context and the code file. The code file will have both parts of code to each day's challenge. For all challenges, i've tried to use relevant code architectures to make my code easy to read and re-usable.
